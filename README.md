## 📌 Project Description

API integration is a vital aspect of modern web development, enabling applications to communicate and retrieve data from external services. In this project, I used the **GNews API** to fetch and display news articles dynamically.

The core objective was to:

- Fetch 4 random news articles in **English** from **India**
- Implement a **“Get News”** button to refresh articles dynamically
- Ensure **non-repetitive content** each time the user clicks refresh

- ✅ **Filtered logic** to avoid repeated articles
